			<h2>Recipes</h2>
			<h4>Red Lentil Soup (Pareve) - Jean Goldstein</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1¼ cups red lentils</li>
				<li>½ cup white rice</li>
				<li>warm water for soaking
</li>
				<li>¼ cup vegetable oil
</li>
				<li>1 large yellow onion, chopped
</li>
				<li>8 cups hot water
</li>
				<li>1½ Tbsp instant pareve chicken soup mix
</li>
				<li>1 tsp ground cumin
</li>
				<li>1 Tbsp olive oil
</li>
				<li>salt to taste
</li>
				<li>lemon wedges to garnish (optional)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>

	<li>Place lentils and rice in a medium bowl and add water to cover. Soak for
20–30 minutes. Drain and rinse well.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add onion and
sauté until golden about 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add hot water and bring to a boil.</li>
	<li>Stir in drained lentils and rice.</li>
<li>Simmer, covered, for 25–30 minutes until

	<li>Adjust seasonings to taste. Garnish each serving with a lemon wedge, if desired.</li>
</ol>
	<p>Yield: 8 servings. Reheats and/or freezes well.</p>
	<p class="nospace bold">Terrace Tips</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In a rush? Don’t bother soaking lentils and rice. Just rinse them well
			in a strainer under cold running water and drain well.</li>
		<li>Lentils are high in soluble fibre and are a good source of protein.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jean Goldstein</h3>
			<p>Jean Goldstein grew up in Poland. “When I was young, my mother didn’t want me in the kitchen with her, because I was too slow. I couldn’t keep up with her. It wasn’t until I was married that I learned to cook.” As Jean gained confidence, she experimented and expanded her cooking skills. She liked to try new recipes on Milton, her husband, but he didn’t necessarily appreciate her efforts. “That was very good,” he would say, “but don’t bother to make it again!” However, Jean was not discouraged because other people enjoyed her cooking creations.</p>

					<h4>Potato Chip Chicken (Meat, Passover) - Mary Spergel</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1 bag (12 oz/340 g) potato chips</li>
				<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
				<li>1 tsp paprika

</li>
				<li>1 chicken (about 3 lbs/1.4 kg), cut in 8ths  

</li>
				<li>1/3 - 1/4 cup vegetable oil 

</li>
		
</ul>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>

	<li>Preheat oven to 375ºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet or large roasting pan with foil and spray with nonstick spray. 
</li>
	<li>Crush potato chips in a large Ziploc bag. Add garlic powder and 

paprika and shake well to combine.</li>

	<li> Rinse chicken pieces. Pat dry. Dip each piece in oil to coat the skin.</li>

	<li>Add chicken pieces, a few at a time, to potato chip mixture. Seal bag 

and shake well so that chicken pieces are well coated.</li>

	<li>Arrange in a single layer in prepared pan.</li>

	<li>Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes, or until golden and crispy.</li>
</ol>
	<p>Yield: 4 servings. Reheats and/or freezes well. </p>
	<p class="nospace bold">Terrace Tips</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For a lower-fat version, remove skin from chicken before breading. 

Instead of dipping chicken in oil, dip in a beaten egg. </li>
		<li>Chicken Fingers or Nuggets: Instead of chicken pieces, substitute 4 

boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into long strips or chunks. Prepare as directed. Bake for 15 minutes at 400°F, turning chicken 

fingers over halfway through cooking. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mary Spergel</h3>
			<p>“This recipe was always a family favourite and a definite crowd pleaser.&nbsp;It 

was quick and easy and could be prepared with very little notice, except for 

one thing.&nbsp;The recipe calls for potato chips.&nbsp;My husband loved potato 

chips.&nbsp;I would buy them and hide them.&nbsp;He would find them and eat 

them.&nbsp;My daughter came up with a simple solution.&nbsp;“Buy 2 bags – 1 for him 

and one for you.’&nbsp;It worked, but it was more fun the other way!”&nbsp;Mary’s 

daughter, Barbara Ross, said that her mother worked at jobs ranging from 

bookkeeper to salesclerk. “She channeled much of her time and energy into 

a variety of charitable organizations. My mother was awarded the Lieutenant 

Governor’s Award for Volunteerism in 1982 at a ceremony at the Ontario 

Legislature.”

<p>
“This was a lovely dish for us to eat after a day of skiing. Ena adapted this 

“Best One-Dish Meals” recipe from <em>Canadian Living</em> years ago. It 

originally included bacon and was topped with buttered bread crumbs, both 

of which Ena omitted.</p>

						<h2>Once Upon A Ta'am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The word ta’am is a Yiddish and Hebrew word meaning taste. The title of this
						book, <strong>A Ta'am to Remember</strong>, is a pun intertwining two themes — the recipes
						and memories that were shared so graciously by residents of the Terraces.
						
						</p>
						<p>This book was a volunteer-driven project that spanned 8 years. In the interim,
						many of the resident-contributors passed away and sadly they did not have the
						chance to see their names, recipes and anecdotes in print. We regret the many
						unavoidable delays, but we were determined to create a professional cookbook
						that would have made them proud. We hope that their families will treasure their
						legacy of wonderful recipes and personal stories.</p>
						<p>
						Our book is launching in time for the 40th anniversary of the Terraces in 2016
						and reuniting the Terraces with David (Sonny) Langer. He was a Baycrest
						administrator who envisioned the model for the Terraces and became its first
						director. David and his wife, Lorraine, have generously sponsored our cookbook.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are grateful to the residents and their families who were so willing to share
						their personal stories, both poignant and funny. Some residents spoke about the
						varied hardships of their early years – growing up during the Great Depression,
						surviving the Holocaust and/or adjusting to life as immigrants. Others described
						how their mothers maintained kashruth (dietary laws), even in communities
						where there were no local shoichets and kosher food. Many residents reflected
						on the culinary influences of their mothers and grandmothers. Others recounted
						the challenges of being newlyweds or working mothers and having to feed their
						husbands and children without the advantages of the modern kitchen. These
						women were proud cooks and their identities were often defined by their cooking.
						Many of them did not have careers. They were the last true generation of
						stay-at-home moms.</p>
						<p>
						<strong>A Ta'am to Remember</strong> was the vision of Rachel Orlan, a Terraces resident
						who wanted to publish a kosher cookbook with anecdotes from her neighbours.
						She believed the book could be a fundraiser and approached Terraces staff,
						who were extremely supportive. As Rachel collected recipes, Rivka Gellis, the
						therapeutic recreationist, and Rachel Weiss, her student, started organizing them.
						Unfortunately, we were unable to include all the submissions, because of space
						limitations and the similarity of many of the recipes.</p>
						<p>
						I became involved in the project after Rivka spoke to my mother, Dorothy
						Riegelhaupt, who was a Terraces resident at the time. She told Rivka that I worked
						with Norene Gilletz, Canada’s leading author of kosher cookbooks. I, in turn,
						recruited Norene to professionally edit the recipes. Throughout the years, Norene
						has been our guiding force beyond editing the 192 recipes. She has offered her
						wisdom and expertise in every aspect of the book, from its design and marketing
						to the recruitment of volunteers.
						</p>
						<p>
						Our volunteers performed a myriad of jobs. A large contingent of recipe testers
						shopped, cooked, baked, tasted and even retested recipes. Some people typed,
						proofread and edited, while others interviewed and photographed the residents.
						There were volunteers who helped with the art and design of the book and still
						others who worked on marketing and sales.</p>
						<p>
						There was also a small group of hardworking volunteers, who dedicated an
						incredible amount of time to this project. Helene Medjuck aptly dubbed this
						group the Ta’am Team, after she had coined the title of the book, <strong>A Ta’am
						to Remember</strong>. I am so grateful to the Ta’am Team for their commitment,
						enthusiasm and, especially, their staying power. Of course, I would be remiss
						if I didn't mention my husband, Marty, who has been a tremendous source of
						guidance and support throughout this long journey.</p>
						<p>
						A special mention must be made to our graphic designer, Aaron Feldman, who
						patiently worked with us and transformed our ideas into a beautifully designed
						book. Many thanks to Sheila Smyth, the former director of the Terraces. Sheila
						was extremely supportive of this project from the onset and, even after her
						retirement, she continued to provide invaluable guidance and assistance. My deep
						appreciation goes to Cindy Beer, Barbara Silverstein and Irene Yared, who spent
						countless hours with me and went beyond the call of volunteer duty.
					</p>
					<p>
						Without the wonderful support of our entire volunteer corps, <strong>A Ta’am to
						Remember</strong> could not have been published. We are extremely proud of this
						cookbook. The recipes and memories truly honour the lives and times of the
						residents of the Terraces of Baycrest.</p>

						<h2>Tribute to David &amp; Lorraine Langer</h2>
					</header>
					<img src="./Baycrest Terraces Cookbook_files/dll.jpg">
					<p>
David “Sonny” Langer knows what it takes to turn a vision into a reality. In the
1970s, he was part of the dedicated team that drew up the blueprint for the
Terraces of Baycrest, one of the first supportive housing facilities for seniors in
Canada. When it opened in 1976, David became the first administrator, a position
he held until 1979.</p>
<p>David began his career at Baycrest in the mid ’60s. He served as director of
volunteers, assistant administrator of the Jewish Home for the Aged (now the
Apotex Centre) and later as assistant director of the Day Care Centre.
In 1972, Walter Lyons, a Baycrest administrator and social worker, recruited David
for the Terraces project. “Walter was a visionary at the forefront of geriatrics,”
David said. “Walter understood what the Terraces could be. The original plans
were just for an apartment building, but he imagined a community that would
keep seniors active and engaged.”</p>
<p>
David helped design an award-winning building linking the Terraces, an apartment
tower with a dining room, to the Joseph E. and Minnie Wagman Seniors Centre,
its programming arm. “The fact that the two buildings were attached made this
facility the first of its kind. That’s the uniqueness of the Terraces!”
David likened the Wagman Centre to “the main street in a town. It was the centre
of life. Everything was there.” He said the swimming pool, exercise room,
greenhouse, Creative Arts Studio and library all bustled with activity. There were
2 synagogues – an Orthodox synagogue that mainly attracted men, and a Reform
congregation started by women who wanted egalitarian services. “On Shabbat,
the Orthodox service ended early so the men ran to the Reform service for the
kiddish. The beauty of it was that it worked.”
</p>
<p>
David also envisioned an innovative triangular design for the apartment building,
with a communal space where residents could congregate. “Each floor had to have
a leader. We encouraged people to be as involved and self-sufficient as possible.”
The philosophy was to have a self-operating building, run primarily by the
residents. They operated the grocery store, dry-cleaning depot, coffee shop and the
elevators. One resident even convinced a bank to open a branch in the building.
“It was a vital community,” he said. “It had a wonderful, caring atmosphere that
I don’t think has been duplicated anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
David can still recall the names of residents and staff from 40 years ago. “I got to
know them and their backgrounds. There was such a mixing of education and
cultures. Some were born in Canada, others came from Europe. There were
Holocaust survivors. Many worked on Spadina. The residents were good people.
They were lovely, sharp, smart, fun and cultured. They were gems. They made the
Terraces what it is today.”
</p>
<p>
David said food was an important aspect of Terraces life. Many friendships
developed in the dining room, and the coffee shop became a popular meeting place.
Residents also sat on the food committee and helped out at the barbecues. They
even organized the Terraces first anniversary celebration and did all the baking.
“I view food as the key to socializing. It’s the centre of everything,” said David,
now a successful Toronto caterer. “My wife, Lorraine, was instrumental in helping
me launch my catering business.” Sonny Langer’s Catering has become so
popular that David is proud to be known as the “Shiva King.”
</p>
<p>
Now David has come full circle. After setting the tenor for life at the Terraces
decades ago, he has provided major financial sponsorship for this cookbook.
David and Lorraine's generosity have made it possible for the residents’ recipes
and personal stories to be a lasting legacy for their families and the community.
On behalf of the residents, the Resident Council, and the cookbook team,
we salute your commitment to the Terraces and its community spirit.

						<h2>Tribute to Norene Gilletz</h2>
					</header>
						<img src="./Baycrest Terraces Cookbook_files/norene.jpg" class="float-right">
						<div>
							<p>
							We would not have been able to publish this cookbook without Norene Gilletz at
the helm. She was committed to the project from the start, offering her wisdom
on many aspects of the book apart from editing recipes. Norene is a true Canadian
treasure, with roots in Winnipeg, Montreal and Toronto. She is a food writer, food
consultant, cookbook editor and the author of 11 kosher cookbooks.
</p>
<p>
Norene’s culinary career was launched with <strong>Second
Helpings Please!</strong>, one of Canada’s most successful
cookbooks. It was published in 1968 by B’nai B’rith
Women in Montreal. Norene was the editor and the
driving force behind this book. “It all started at a tea
membership,” she recounted. “Our baking was so
delicious that someone suggested we write a
cookbook. We thought it would take 3 months, but
it took 3 years.”
</p>
<p>
Norene joined our project because she believes in
community cookbooks. “That’s where I started
from,” she said. “The Terraces recipes are from
people who cooked on a daily basis to feed their
families.” She pointed out that many residents were
intuitive cooks who did not use written recipes.
Fortunately, Norene is a self-proclaimed recipe
detective. “I have recipe antennae. For the Terraces
recipes, I often had to quantify and modify many
ingredients and clarify the directions, but I always
maintained the integrity of these recipes. I also
made suggestions in the Terrace Tips, often with a
dash of humour.”</p>
<p>
Norene said <strong>A Ta’am to Remember</strong> is more than a cookbook. “It includes
snippets of the lives of women who shared their favourite family recipes along
with touching memories.” Norene was passionate about the legacy of this book.
“These recipes are a lasting way to immortalize these women.”

						<h2>Message from the Resident Council</h2>
					</header>
					<p>For generations, Jewish families sitting around the dinner table have solved
						problems, discussed ideas, entertained friends, celebrated holidays and welcomed
						strangers and newcomers.</p>
						<p>
						The recipes in this book come from Jewish families who lived in Europe, South
						America and Canada. The Residents and their families wanted to share their
						treasured recipes which were enjoyed by their families and friends. Many of the
						recipes reflect European style cooking of older generations. All the recipes have
						been tested in Toronto kitchens of today and they have stood the test of time.
						</p>
						<p>
						As one resident said: “My mother was a wonderful cook and we enjoyed our
						meals together. I wish there had been a book like this to pass along some of her
						secrets as well as stories to link us with a different time and place.”
